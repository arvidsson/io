# io

Allegro 5 C++ rapid game prototyping framework in a single header-file.

## Usage

Define `IO_IMPLEMENTATION` in *one* .cpp file before including `io.h`.

```cpp
#define IO_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "io.h"

class Skeleton : public io::Game
{
public:
    void update(const io::Input& input) override
    {
        if (input.is_key_down(ALLEGRO_KEY_ESCAPE))
        {
            quit();
        }
    }
    
    void render() override
    {
        // ...
    }
};

IO_MAIN
{
    io::init();
    auto game = std::make_unique<Skeleton>();
    game->run();
}
IO_END
```
